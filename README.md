## This a OS Runescape launcher for Linux systems through snaps (Snapcraft)

To install visit https://snapcraft.io/os-runes

#### The proccess

The snap only holds the environment to run a java application. 

When started it will download the launcher which is responsble for download the Windows installer from Jagex and extract the game. Since it's java based, the game will run normally inside the snap keeping your system safe.

#### Currently I can't make the sound work, probably the .yaml is missing some library. If you know how to fix please let me know
