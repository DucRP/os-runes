#### The proccess

The snap only holds the environment to run a java application. 

When started it will download the launcher which is responsble for download the Windows installer from Jagex and extract the game. Since it's java based, the game will run normally inside the snap keeping your system safe.

#### Sound was fixed and is working, yay!
